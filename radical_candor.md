## Radical Candor
by Kim Scott

The two types of people you need on your team:
Rockstars : People who love their job and are fantastic at it but have no urgency to rise up the corporate ladder or become the next VP etc. They're the stabilizing rocks/constants in the team
Superstar : Steeper growth trajectory, always focused on growing and the next step/promotion

Good quote: (At Apple) We hire people to tell us what to do.

The competition in tech is so intense that your relationships matter a great deal. If you don't like your boss, you quit and there will be ten other companies lining up to hire you.

Two components of radical candor:
1. Care personally : Acknowledge that the people on your team are human beings with lives beyond the workplace. Get to know them personally, understand what motivates them and genuinely care about what happens to them
2. Challenge directly : With both criticism and praise, be as specific as you can, focus on the work rather than making attributions to a person. Vague praise (eg. You did good work today. What was the work ? What was good about it? etc) and sugarcoated criticism sound insincere and erode trust.

## Tiny Habits: The Small Changes that Change Everything
by BJ Fogg

Motivation and willpower are overrated. The "Motivation Monkey" will start with you on some days but will desert you after a while, especially on days that are difficult. Therefore, one can't depend entirely on motivation to achieve a goal or cultivate new habits.
Fogg recommends thinking about habits using the following equation:
Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt
(or B = MAP)

Plotting ability and motivation on an XY axis, he states that rather than relying on motivation, we can focus on making the habit easier to do. Two concepts that I enjoyed around this:
* Starter step: The simplest step you can take towards your new habit. For example, if your goal is to run every day for 30 minutes, a starter step might be that each morning you put on your running shoes. You can go for a run or not but the only commitment is to put on the shoes
* Scale back: Reducing the magnitude to make the habit truly tiny. For example, running 1 minute each day instead of 30 minutes

These concepts seem to be applicable even in business contexts. As a leader, instead of telling people to solve problems like "continuous deployment" and holding out my praise until they solve the entire challenge I could say "What's the tiniest step we could take this sprint to move us towards hands free deployments?" and then celebrating that achievement. Similar for getting people to review more PRs - challenge them to start with a habit of just reading the description of one PR each morning.

Also loved the concept of "Action prompts" - Pick a habit that is already well established and anchor your new habit to that existing habit. Eg. "After I put my breakfast eggs in the microwave I will .....". He contrasts these with context prompts like calendar reminders, emails or notifications and makes the point that these have become voluminous to the point that we have started ignoring these prompts. Again, significant application to business contexts as well - in the code review example above "After I click the TMP auth button in the morning, I will read the description of one PR"
